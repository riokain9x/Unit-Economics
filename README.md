## Analysis Methodology

### Data Processing with Python & Pandas

The analysis was conducted using Python with the following approach:

1. **Data Collection:** Connected to Google Sheets APIs to extract real-time data
2. **Data Cleaning:** Processed and filtered data for March 2023
3. **Metric Calculations:** Computed key unit economics metrics
4. **Insight Generation:** Analyzed results against industry benchmarks

### Key Metrics Calculated

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
```python
# Components: CRM costs + Sales/Marketing payroll + Marketing spending
CAC = total_sales_mrkt_expenses / number_of_new_customers
```

**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**
```python
ARPU = total_revenue / num_users
```

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
```python
# Components: Server costs + Software licenses + Engineering salaries
COGS = production_salaries + server_n_software_expense
```

**Gross Margin**
```python
gross_margin = (total_revenue - COGS) / total_revenue * 100
```

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```python
LTV = avg_lifespan_months * ARPU * (gross_margin / 100)
```

## Key Findings & Business Health Assessment

### LTV/CAC Ratio Analysis
The LTV/CAC ratio shows if your business makes money from customers:
- Below 1.0x â†’ Losing money (bad)
- 1.0x to 3.0x â†’ Making some money (needs work)
- 3.0x to 5.0x â†’ Good profit (healthy business)
- Above 5.0x â†’ Excellent profit (very successful)

### Gross Margin Check
How much profit you keep after basic costs:
- 70%+ â†’ Excellent performance
- 60-70% â†’ Good performance  
- 40-60% â†’ Okay (can improve)
- Below 40% â†’ Poor (fix costs)

### Customer Metrics
- **ARPU**: How much money each customer pays you
- **CAC**: How much you spend to get one new customer
- **Customer Lifespan**: How long customers stay with you
